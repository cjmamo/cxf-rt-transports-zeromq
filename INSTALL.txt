Runtime requirements:

- Apache CXF 2.7.2
- ZeroMQ 2.2.0 or 3.2.2
- jzmq 2.1.0 (ZeroMQ Java language binding)


Installation instructions:

1. Install Maven and from your console enter the following command in the project's root folder:
   "mvn package -Djzmq.path=[jzmq path]". This will produce a JAR in the "target" folder called
   "cxf-rt-transports-zeromq-[version].jar".

2. Add the ZeroMQ transport JAR to your application's classpath. You must also add jzmq's "zmq.jar" to the classpath.

3. Point your application's Java VM native library path to jzmq's lib folder (e.g., -Djava.library.path=/opt/jzmq/lib).
